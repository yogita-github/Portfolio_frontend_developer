I am Yogita Vinayak Mahajan, a BE graduate with a deep passion for technology. I completed my degree in Computer Science Engineering at Shram Sadhana Trust College of Engineering and Technology, Bambhori. My secondary and high school education was at Godavari English Medium CBSE School, where I secured 5th rank and maintained a CGPA of 9.2. One of my hobbies is reading novels, which not only provides relaxation but also enriches my vocabulary and imaginative thinking.
